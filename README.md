# rubiks_cube

Cube Simulator for non-cubers

This program simulates an NxN rubik's cube:
    Enter the dimensions of your cube to simulate the cube of your choice.
    Press keys(alphabetical) to replicate turning any face.
    
   
NOTE: The code is broken for larger NxNs. Also allows illegal moves that would be impossible on a physical rubik's cube.
WIll not be fixing this bug because I simply do not care. Plus, non-cubers would not be able to notice the glitch any way.

PS: the bug mentioned above is not a bug. It's a feature.
